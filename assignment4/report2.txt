- How much is gained by switching to numpy?

Vectorization was applied once and not much time has been cut down
from doing so (about 9 seconds). The double for-loop itself doesn't
spend much time (I'd say about 10-15 seconds). It is the following code
that consumes much time:
"vmandel_res = vmandelbrot(complex_list, maxiter)" line 79


- Parameters used to generate the image:

I ran the code through mandelbrot.py (exercise 4.5) and this is
what I wrote in the terminal:
>>python mandelbrot.py -2.0 1.0 -1.0 1.0 1000 result.jpg


- Runtime for each script:

runtime for mandelbrot_1.py ---> 137,64 seconds
runtime for mandelbrot_2.py ---> 128,51 seconds
